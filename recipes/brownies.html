                <ul>
                    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Line a 8 by 8-inch pan with foil or parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>In a microwave safe bowl, add the butter and sugar. Microwave for about 1 minute, or until the butter is melted. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.</li>
                    <li>With a rubber spatula, stir in the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
                    <li>Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the brownies are set and a cake tester inserted into the center has moist crumbs attached. Do not overcook. Let cool completely before cutting and serving.</li>
